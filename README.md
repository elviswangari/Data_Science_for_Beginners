## 1. Introduction to Git and GitHub

### What is Git?
- Git is a version control system that helps track changes in code.
- Think of Git as a way to save "checkpoints" in your project.
- It allows multiple people to collaborate on projects without losing track of changes.
- Git is a tool to track changes in files over time.
- Think of Git as a way to save "checkpoints" in your project.

### What is GitHub?
- GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories.
- It allows you to store, manage, and collaborate on Git projects online.
- GitHub is a cloud platform where you can store your Git projects online.
- It makes it easy to collaborate with others and keep your code safe.

### Why Use Git and GitHub?
- Manage code versions.
- Collaborate efficiently with team members.
- Keep a backup of your projects.

## 3. Practical Part 1: Cloning an Existing Repository

### Scenario: Download (clone) an existing project from GitHub and make some changes.

1. **Create a repository on GitHub**:
    - Go to GitHub, click New Repository.
    - Name it `my-cloned-repo`, leave it empty for now (no files), and click Create.

2. **Copy the repository URL**:
    - On the repo page, click the green Code button and copy the URL.

3. **Clone the repository to your computer**:
    - Open Terminal/Command Prompt and type:
      ```bash
      git clone <GitHub-Repository-URL>
      ```
    - This will create a folder with the name of the repository.

4. **Navigate to the cloned repository**:
    ```bash
    cd my-cloned-repo
    ```

5. **Create a new file (example: hello.txt)**:
    ```bash
    echo "Hello from the cloned repo!" > hello.txt
    ```

6. **Stage and commit the file**:
    - Stage the file:
      ```bash
      git add hello.txt
      ```
    - Commit the changes:
      ```bash
      git commit -m "Add hello.txt"
      ```

7. **Push the changes back to GitHub**:
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

8. **Check GitHub**: Youâ€™ll see your new file online in your repo.

## 4. Practical Part 2: Creating a Local Repository with `git init` (10 minutes)

1. **Create a new folder on your computer**:
    - Name it `git_project` and navigate into it using the terminal:
      ```bash
      mkdir git_project 
      cd git_project
      ```

2. **Initialize Git in the folder**:
    ```bash
    git init
    ```
    - This tells Git to start tracking changes in this folder.

3. **Create a new file (example: readme.txt)**:
    ```bash
    echo "This is a local repo." > readme.txt
    ```

4. **Stage and commit the file**:
    - Stage the file:
      ```bash
      git add readme.txt
      ```
    - Commit the changes:
      ```bash
      git commit -m "Add readme.txt"
      ```

5. **Create a new repository on GitHub**:
    - Go to GitHub, click New Repository.
    - Name it `github_project` and create it.

6. **Connect your local repo to GitHub**:
    - In your terminal, link the local repo to the GitHub repo:
      ```bash
      git remote add origin <GitHub-Repository-URL>
      ```

7. **Push your changes to GitHub**:
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```

8. **Check GitHub**: Your local files will be uploaded.
